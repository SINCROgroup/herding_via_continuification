# herding_via_continuification

In this folder we collect the numerical simulations and experiments that are discussed in [1]. These regard a shepherding control problem, where a group of herder agents is tasked to confine a large group of target agents into a predefined goal region. 

Folder organization:

- "numerical_trial.mp4": video of the simulation discussed in Section IV.A of [1], where 280 herders have to corall 720 targets into a circular goal region.

- "experimental_trial.mp4": video of the experiment discussed in Section IV.B of [1], where 20 differential drive robots have to corall 80 virtual target agents into a circular goal region (experiments are run in the Robotarium [2, 3]).
