# herding_via_continuification

In this folder we collect the experiments that are discussed in [1]. These experiments regard a shepherding control problem, where a group of 20 differential drive robots is tasked to collect a swarm of virtual agents (simulated random walkers) into a predefined circular region. Experiments have been done in the Robotarium [2, 3]
